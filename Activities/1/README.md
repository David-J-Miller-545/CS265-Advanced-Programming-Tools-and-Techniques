# Heading

A new paragraph

## Subheading

This is a paragrah. A *paragraph*. I said, "**paragraph!**"

- item
- another item
- something else

1. thing 1 
2. thing 2
3. thing 3

Here is inline math: $17 + \frac{x}{2\sin{5\Theta}}$

This is a `variable`.

~~~
echo "Hello"
echo "This is a Bash script"
~~~

> This is quoted
> text. IT'll be indented.

And, another paragraph.
