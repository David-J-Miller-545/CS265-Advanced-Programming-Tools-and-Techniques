Q1.
The single quotes are an identifer for awk to know what to look for for its code.

Q2.
sed '/the/ d' s1

Q3.
You did not need to use single quotes and could have used double quotes instead, the reason why is because sed
identifies both single and double opposed to awk which only identifies single.

Q4.
$ sed '/<head>/,/<\/head>/ {s/Kurt/Vera/g}' s1
