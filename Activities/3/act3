Q1.
knife, hat, and chocolate

Q2.
Because anything inside of parentheses runs in a subshell thus the x=27 only exists there which is was the
echo within the x was able to print it and the one outside was not.

Q3.
The x is still unassinged because we are feeding it directly into the subshell that printx script is running in.

Q4.
This is because x belongs in our current shell and is not set for export therefore when we run printx the subshell doesn't have
a variable x within it and doesn't recieve our x from our shell.
