Q1.
It prints true because the character 2 comes before 1 and therefore 2 is greater than 13, thus making that
statement true and allowing the echo of "true"

Q2.
Nothing because all of the output was sent to null (the abyss) instead of outputting.

Q3.
The output is 2 because everything within the let function is an integer thus can not have any decimal points.

Q4.
The echo returned 0 because the command before was successfully executed.

Q5.
$ unset x	<- unsets x from the shell
$ ( x=12 ; echo "5 $x 13" )
5 12 13		<- x was set and only exists in the let.
$ echo "5 $x 13"
5  13			<- x is unset in the shell so it doesn't print.
