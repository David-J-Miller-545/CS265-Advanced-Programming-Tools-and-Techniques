Hey so I wanted to real quickly comment on me having to switch languages in the middle of the code, I was doing a lot of
testing while I was developing and thinking about how I was going to make this script. When I was testing I ran into
some errors with the sorting and after about 10 minutes of searching the 10k line file I realized that it was ignoring
the case without the flag to do so, so I went to the man page and then google to see if there was a flag where I could
make it case sensitive. Well as it turns out, I didn't find any but I found a reddit post saying how the UTF language
was the thing holding me back and in a little snipbit of code they had "$ LANG=C sort <<< $'a\nb\nA\nB'" they switched
to C, I have zero clue what this means, I don't know if it is C the high-level programming language or what but this
seemed to be the only solution I could find. So then I started using it and then realized that squash was acting up and
keeping the letter keys infront making lines look like "apt apt apt apt pat tap" which wasn't good, so I played and
switched it back, which seemed to work. I hope I don't get points off for this but at the least I was wondering if you
could tell me with my grade report why this was acting very funky the way it was. Also I don't know if this was illegal
or anything for this lab but my script is just a big pipe, sorry if that is not what was intended and please let me know
what else I could have done. Thank you, sorry for the short essay, and have a great day!
