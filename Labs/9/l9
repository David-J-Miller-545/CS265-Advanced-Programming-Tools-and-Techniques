Q1.1)
void stackResize( stack *s, size_t new_size )
{
	s = (stack*) realloc(s, new_size);

	return ;
}

Q2.1)
The program had a segmentation fault and within the directory a new file "core.90256" was added.

Q2.2)
The function that was bombed was inTable().

Q2.3)
c. Was crashing because it was increment line number before reading data therefore when comparing strings, the first
item is a null pointer and crashes, the simple fix is increment after each line is read.
e. Subtraction was the wrong way and so all I did to fix it was reversed the order of subtraction
f. The bug here is accessing bad memory as it tried to recursivly call itself using the pointer (v+last-1) and when last
is 0, it goes to the memory slot before it, the fix to allow this to work properly was replacing -1 with +1.

Q2.4)
It can't ctach this because they are pointers and sytax-wise is correct. Doesn't crash but can't sort properly.

Q2.5)
It crashes because it is trying using cmpstr with ints.
