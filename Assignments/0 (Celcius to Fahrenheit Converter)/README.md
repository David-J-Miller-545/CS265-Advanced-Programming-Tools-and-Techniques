# Bio

I am David Miller, I have zero clue if you actually want us to type this so the most basic response I have is that I
am a 2nd year student within the 5yr CS - Bachelor's program at Drexel University.

## Programming Languages

- Java
- Python
- C++

## Editor

I am currently using the VIM editor however in the past I have grown fond of VS Code.

# Notes

My program does primarily use try, except statements for its selective cases. In the program some nasty things could
also be the ternary statement and the casting within a method call. Overall it is a compact program that completes the
assigned task.
